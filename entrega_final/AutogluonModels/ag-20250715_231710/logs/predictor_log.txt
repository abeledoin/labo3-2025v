train_data with frequency 'IRREG' has been resampled to frequency 'MS'.
Provided train_data has 22375 rows (NaN fraction=0.1%), 780 time series. Median time series length is 36 (min=4, max=36). 
	Removing 75 short time series from train_data. Only series with length >= 9 will be used for training.
	After filtering, train_data has 21916 rows (NaN fraction=0.1%), 705 time series. Median time series length is 36 (min=9, max=36). 

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'tn'
	past_covariates:
		categorical:        []
		continuous (float): ['product_id']

To learn how to fix incorrectly inferred types, please see documentation for TimeSeriesPredictor.fit

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'WQL'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
